# Django_project
I have successfully designed and implemented a web project that includes user authentication features through login and signup pages. 
The frontend of the application is crafted using HTML and CSS to ensure an intuitive and visually appealing user interface. The backend 
logic and server-side handling are powered by Python Django, a robust web framework. With this setup, users can securely sign up for 
accounts, log in, and experience a seamless interaction with the web application. The integration of HTML and CSS ensures a responsive 
and engaging user experience, while Django manages the backend processes efficiently.

Features:
🎨 Sleek Design: Modern and eye-catching UI to enhance user experience.
🔐 Secure Authentication: Django backend ensures robust security for user data.
🚀 Django Magic: Leverage the full potential of Django for a scalable and efficient application.
📝 Customizable: Easily customize and extend the project to fit your unique needs.

How to Run:
📥 Clone the repository.
🚀 Set up your Django environment.
🚢 Run the development server.
🌐 Explore the awesome login and signup experience!
